# ⚽ FootballBettingBuddi

**AI-powered football betting intelligence** with daily **Smart Bets**, market-by-market predictions, and transparent EV/confidence—starting with a docs-first setup (no code yet).

- **Theme:** Dark black–purple, clean and data-rich.
- **MVP Tech:** Vanilla JS frontend later; Node/Express backend later; JSON cache to start; Postgres planned.
- **Daily Routine:** Backend jobs generate 2–5 top Smart Bets each morning and store them historically.
- **User Flow:** Browse fixtures, click **AI Smart Bet** per game or request market-specific predictions, save picks to a personal dashboard (MVP via localStorage).

> This repo currently contains **docs and structure only**. Code lands after we finalize the foundation.
